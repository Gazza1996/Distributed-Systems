## Overview
You are required to use the JAX-RS/Jersey, Java RMI and JAXB frameworks to develop a simple Car Hire
Booking System. A Web Client page should provide users with the ability to Create/Modify/Update/Delete
bookings for a specific vehicle for a given set of dates. The Web Client will interact with a RESTful JAX-RS
Web Service for bookings which is deployed on Apache Tomcat Server. The RESTful Web Service will act as
a RMI client to a RMI Database Server which will handle persistence.

The Apache TomcatÂ® software is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. Apache Tomcat allows the implementation of Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) to promote an effective Java server environment. Users can also access resources for configuration and use extensible markup language (XML) to configure projects. Successive versions of Apache Tomcat have solved different problems by applying software patches and other solutions. Some experts characterize Apache Tomcat as a product offering a runtime shell for Java Servlets. Users can also set up Java virtual machines (JVM) to configure virtual hosting.
